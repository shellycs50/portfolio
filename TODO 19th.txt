about me and contact with barba js as in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMucZErEdZg&ab_channel=DesignCourse

use index as template. 

use simple flex for landing area layout. you want the text size to scale based on vwhMin and past say 400px vw layout becomes a column.

simple and effective. keep about and contact simple and pretty. dont do anything flashy. just flexbox layout. easy as.

by friday need to change add links here to the actual links in MODAL.
and need to use an exit logo on the modal, stop using position fixed on the modal it needs to be relative (to the modal content wrapper).
however. If you can add a scrolltriggered spinning thing great. if you can add scrolltriggered title animation great.
